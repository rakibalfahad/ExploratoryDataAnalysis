# ExploratoryDataAnalysis


## PyCon2017
If you want to visualize some data in Python: which library do you choose? From Matplotlib to Seaborn to Bokeh to Plotly, Python has a range of mature tools to create beautiful visualizations, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In this post Iâ€™ll give an overview of the landscape of data visualization tools in Python, as well as some deeper dives into a few, so that you can intelligently choose which library to turn to for any given visualization task.
